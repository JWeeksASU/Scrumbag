Automating Scrum Elements

    Scrumbag is a project site developed to automate portions of the scrum process. The main site will allow users to enter user stories, tasks, as well as prioritize and assign them point values. Tasks will be arranged in a Product Backlog format and can be easily edited. Point values will be exported to generate a burndown or burn up chart according to the users preference.
